## Question
## Easy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(57 %)
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.
A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

## Examples
1. Example :<br>
    Input: n = 19<br>
    Output: true<br>
    Explanation:<br>
    12 + 92 = 82<br>
    82 + 22 = 68<br>
    62 + 82 = 100<br>
    12 + 02 + 02 = 1
   
2. Example 2:<br>
    Input: n = 2<br>
    Output: false
   
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
//calculated the sum of squares of digits
    int fun(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            int r = n % 10;
            sum += r * r;
            n /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        int slow = n;//taken slow as n intially
        int fast = fun(n);//taken fast as fun(n)
        while (fast != 1 && slow != fast) {//iterated until our fast equals 1 or our slow and fast met, denoting the formation of a cycle, so it is not happy number
            slow = fun(slow);//iterating one step at a time
            fast = fun(fun(fast));//iterating two steps at a time
        }    
        return fast == 1;//returns true if they are equal or else false
    }
};
```
